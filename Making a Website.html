<h1>Making a Website- 23 Jan 2025</h1>

<p>Having a website and posting blogs and other writings is something that I had always wanted (and had even tried, to an extent- check out my neocities website<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>, my universe website<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>, and my wix website).<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> I also maintained a Medium page: I still have my account, and the articles I&#39;ve written can be read- I no longer contribute to it, though.</p>

<p>A few years ago, out of fascination, I started using Obsidian<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> to take notes- I wrote a lot, so I liked having a &quot;minimal&quot; application where I could just write what I want. That being said, it took me some time to get the hang of it- I had been using Google Keep for many years (and I still do), and having to use an app that was purely local was baffling for me.</p>

<p>That being said, I quickly got used to Obsidian, and began using it as my full-time note-taking application- in fact, I&#39;m writing <em>this</em> article in Obsidian. I began using it for taking notes in my classes, for my master&#39;s degree. I was using it  on three devices: my phone, my laptop, and my tablet. This is where I ran into an issue: I could not start writing a note on my phone/tablet, and continue writing it on my laptop (while this might sound very specific, it happened quite often). Obsidian did have a sync feature, but it was paid (I eventually did figure out a free way to sync notes between my phone and laptop).<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>That was when I got an idea: what if I made a website to store my notes? I wouldn&#39;t be able to edit them like I could on Google Keep, but access on all my devices was guaranteed. One idea was that I could upload to the website all the notes I had taken in an entire semester, and it would be there for future reference. This, paired with my earlier excitement to make a website worked out well- I spent a good chunk of my winter break figuring out how to turn my notes into a good website.</p>

<p>This was when I re-discovered Steph Ango&#39;s website<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>, which I absolutely fell in love with. Imagine my surprise when I realised that his website was built <em>with</em> Obsidian. But there was a problem: the process to turn Obsidian notes into a functioning website was fairly technical- and I wasn&#39;t someone who knew how to work with GitHub or write code in Ruby.</p>

<p>As I explored all the ways to make a website, I came across my neocities website: it was made entirely in HTML, which I barely knew. But it did give me an idea: what if I <em>made</em> my website by myself? After all, HTML <em>is</em> a markup language, like Markdown, which I was used to, because Obsidian was using it.</p>

<p>Using HTML to make a working website certainly seemed possible. It was easy to understand, and within about an hour of fiddling with it, I had a working webpage: on Visual Studio Code. I still did not know how to get it on the web- I did not know how I could get my HTML file on the web. After reading tutorials and how-tos, I hesitantly created a GitHub account and created a new repository for my website. I put my HTML files in the repository, and voila! I had a working website.</p>

<p>Over the next few days, I spent my time understanding how CSS worked, and in some time, I had a working stylesheet that gave me promising results. As of writing this, I still have to figure things out in the CSS file, such as how to format an image, and how to make working footnotes (you'll notice that the footnotes are working now- I figured them out a day after writing this).</p>

<p>But yes, as of now, I&#39;ve a working website. There is still a lot to learn and figure out, and here&#39;s to that. ü§åüèº</p>
