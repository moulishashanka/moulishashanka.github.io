<p>I do not remember what time I had awoken, but I do remember this: I stared out the window, and onto a board, a milestone, that read: <em>Bhuj: 70 km</em>. I sat up, and looked around. I&#39;ve been awake since, and the bus has been passing through hamlets and towns on the way to Bhuj. As I look through the window now, I am witnessing perhaps my closest windmill ever: there&#39;s more of them, but the one closest to me appears to be moving at a snail&#39;s pace, much like others I&#39;ve seen.
        A peculiar thing I remember seeing in the past one or two hours I&#39;ve been awake is the pigeon-houses. <em>Chabutaras</em>, I hear they&#39;re called. They&#39;re everywhere, really. Most of them look quite young, and located within small villages. I glance at the occasional Banyan tree, and at the numerous Gujarati signboards- on the buildings, on billboards, and on fellow buses and trucks. I attempt to read them, marking this as practice for what I hope to do more of at Bhuj.
        We&#39;re passing through a small hamlet, and one thing that catches my eye is the clothing of the women: they resemble that of the lambadi tribe. The dresses are long, and most of them seem to be elaborately made with sequins and mirrors. Unlike the lambadis I&#39;ve seen, though, these women cover their breasts with a blouse. Perhaps we&#39;re getting closer to the desert.
        I begin to see distant hills, surrounding the bus near the horizon. I am reminded of my classmate, Niranj&#39;s, presentation. Bhuj is surrounded by these hills, forming a...bowl of sorts.
        ![[IMG_20240823_070207260.jpg]]
        ![[IMG_20240823_070200858.jpg]]
        <em>Above: As meager as images I could get of the hills from inside the bus. They&#39;re quite beautiful, really, if one were to see them in person.</em>
        There are these small pump-heads (well I am assuming that they&#39;re some part of pumps) that we pass by, many of them, they sort of remind me of many an elaborate temple column.
        We pass through some hills which look like they&#39;re being torn down and stripped for their minerals and soil. Interestingly, we pass by a <em>Krishna Water Park</em> near these half-stripped hills.
        I just see another chabutara and a banyan tree, both of which have extremely narrow &quot;trunks&quot; and a very wide canopy (proportionally, that is).
        A classmate of mine has woken up: seems like I was too preoccupied with looking out the window that I didn&#39;t notice her pass by my seat. She goes to the driver&#39;s cabin, talks with them, and comes back and greets me a good morning. &quot;We&#39;ll reach in about half an hour,&quot; she tells me. &quot;Oh yes, I&#39;ve been noticing the boards,&quot; I reply.
        She goes around the bus, attempting to wake the rest of our group up: the bus is late by more than an hour.
        I pass by a very interesting looking muslim building. ![[IMG_20240823_071654718_HDR.jpg]]
        <em>The Muslim building. With my current speed at which I can read Gujarati, I think it reads &quot;Dargah Sharif...&quot;</em>
        I pass by a billboard for kutchi handlooms, and several dhabas- people are sitting on the benches outside, drinking tea.
        Two of my classmates have woken up: I hear their voices from behind my seat.
        Most entrances into hamlets seem to begin with arches like these:
        ![[IMG_20240823_072320299.jpg]]
        I see the Bhujio hill! And the Smritivan museum!
        ![[IMG_20240823_072403229.jpg]]
        I see the city now. We seem to be on the outer ring road, near what we&#39;ve earlier identified to be the RTO circle. The city itself, it appears expansive- yet, not formidable. It&#39;s surprisingly monotonous, with a lot of buildings in white.
        Bhuj being the last major city in India away from Pakistan (in this area, atleast ) does have a significant military presence: we pass by a military camp, with armoured tanks and soldiers passing around the gate.
        The bus stops, and all nine of us have a surprisingly calm getting-down, and we&#39;re absolutely swarmed by auto-drivers asking us where we want to go. It is quite hot, but it seems to be a dry heat- better than the heat in Ahmedabad. I hope I&#39;m right- to bear a humidity like Ahmedabad would be quite the thing. Atleast I&#39;ve gotten my umbrella with me. We bargain with two auto-drivers and load our bags on top of two giant vehicles. It is four of us in one vehicle, and the other five in one. As we make the journey to our hotel, the girls talk and mentally try to place where we are in the city that we seem to have known. We pass by the grand newly made Swaminarayan temple on the left. I see traces of old art deco, like the on a in Hyderabad. I finally see the Hamirsar lake and the old buildings surrounding it- they&#39;re quite an interesting sight to behold. Suhana identifies one of the &quot;old buildings&quot; as Sarpat gate, and chuckles, &quot;mazaa aagaya.&quot;
        I see a father-son duo in front of a shop. The father is dressed in a plain shirt and shorts, and the kid is dressed in a school uniform. They&#39;re waiting for the school bus, perhaps. The kid is tapping and playing with his father&#39;s hair.
        We stop in front of the prag mahal, in what seems to be a small centre. We&#39;re searching for the hotel.
        ![[IMG_20240823_074429712_HDR.jpg]]![[IMG_20240823_074438326.jpg]]

        ![[IMG_20240823_074637455.jpg]]
        <em>Above: an entrance to the Prag Mahal. Actually, I&#39;m not sure. A board near these doors seems to point that it might be the Aina Mahal too. But this looked interesting enough.</em>
        We walk towards the hotel, and we&#39;re greeted by a small board that greets us in multiple languages.
        ![[IMG_20240823_074939395.jpg]]
        <em>Above: the hotel greets us in English, Polish, French, German, and Mandarin</em>
        ![[IMG_20240823_075723389.jpg]]<em>Above: Each of the rooms seems to have been named after a gate in the city. We&#39;ve checked into Bhid Gate.</em>
        ![[IMG_20240823_080034732.jpg]]
        <em>Above: the view from the terrace. Suhana wasn&#39;t wrong when she said we were &quot;staying at the Prag Mahal&quot;.</em>
        The photo barely does any justice to what we see in person.
        We had a photo of us taken, with the Prag Mahal in the background.
        ![[IMG-20240823-WA0008.jpg]]
        <em>Above: a group photo of us. To the left in the photo is yours truly. As I write this caption, I&#39;m realising how I absolutely tower over everyone in my class, lmao.</em>
        We go back into our rooms, and are ambushed by four of our classmates, who negotiate Niranj into exchanging our room for theirs. I take our luggage into the room opposite ours and sit on the bed. &quot;I&#39;ll need to take less photos,&quot; I remember.
        As I get my things out to brush, I realise that in the hurry, I had forgotten to get a toothpaste. I go to the girls&#39; room and borrow one.
        I brush and bathe, and change my clothes. Remember when I said the heat was a dry heat in Bhuj? Well, I realised it doesn&#39;t matter, because I&#39;m sweating anyway. How nice.
        Me and a classmate, Bhavya, discuss about our internships and about the Art of Living. We seem to know some people in common.
        I walk up to the terrace and find a bicycle pump and realise it could be used as a hand blown &quot;air conditioner&quot;. I take it with me for the foreseeable day. Me and Sana and Suhana walk outside and are absolutely appalled by the heat: good thing I got my umbrella and the bicycle pump. Me and Sana talk about what to have for breakfast: I being I, suggest something deep-fried, because no germ can survive the heat of 350 Fahrenheit oil. The girls scoff at me, and Sana remarks that she wants to eat idli. I scoff back at her, while also realising that I wanted to eat idli too. A dog comes near us, and I try to feed it biscuits, which it politely declined. I realise if I stop writing to feed dogs, I can never continue writing. I show Sana the things I&#39;m writing. Suhana rants about a man in the bus who snored all night.
        Eight of us stuff ourselves in an auto and go to a breakfast place in the extreme heat. I&#39;ve my bicycle pump and my umbrella to protect me.
        We find a place that seemed to sell parathas and upma and Vada and stuff. The only non-gujaratis in the group, we walk to the place and order some food. As we walk towards the cart, a woman and a young girl seem to find a number of opportunities to ask us for money. We watch along as the woman in the cart makes parathas and a thepla with an absolutely miniscule amount of oil, courtesy of Sana&#39;s request.
        We had a scrumptious breakfast of theplas and parathas, and Sana and I snuck to a phone shop near the food cart for some actual air conditioning in the firey heat of the city. We talked with the shopkeeper about what we could visit in the city, and he replied back saying we could go to the Aina Mahal, the Swaminarayan Temple, the Smritivan museum, and the Vande Mataram memorial.
        We sat in front of a tea shop and discussed where we wanted to go. Me and Bhavya expressed interest in visiting the cenotaphs of the kings, but it was too hot for us to go there. We decided we&#39;d go there the next morning, and hopped onto an auto to go to the hotel, and the darbargarh palace.
        Outside the palace, we drank a spicy lemonade, and headed inside the prag mahal. On the outer walls of the palace, we could see sculptures of Dutch boys, made by the famed Ram Singh Malam.
        ![[IMG_20240823_104330959.jpg]]
        <em>Above: a sculpture of a Dutch boy, holding a cat/dog in his hands,inside the prag mahal complex</em>
        We walk towards the Prag Mahal. On the right side of us, there is what seems to be a rather large section of the palace, destroyed by the earthquake. See the photo below for a broken jharoka. ![[IMG_20240823_104549326.jpg]]
        We continue our way inside, and find ourselves facing the massive facade of the Prag Mahal palace. 
        ![[IMG_20240823_104513396.jpg]]
        The facade is impressively built, and makes me want to climb on top of the structure and jump from the top. 
        I can but barely bring myself to describe the palace, it is exquisitely made in the gothic art style that reminds one of books like Harry Potter.
        We go to meet a man called Pramod Jethi, who was at one time the curator of this palace-museum to talk with him about the history of the area. What follows are his words.</p>
        <p>The history of this city begins with the Jadejas. And how they came here, that&#39;s a story in itself. Kacchh has always been a part of fascinating history. In the 1-3rd centuries CE, this area was ruled by the Western Satraps. There&#39;s inscriptions present about the Satraps in the Kutch museum, dating back to 56 CE and 126 CE. After the Satraps, the area was predominantly Buddhist, and Huien-Tsang in the 6th century CE came to Kacchh, where he describes the sea at Kacchh. Of course, now it&#39;s all a salt marsh, due to the ocean receding. The journey that Huien-Tsang describes, in it he tells us that he saw about 500 monks in a monastery near the area. There&#39;s two areas present today, confirming his claim of monks in the area. 
        In the seventh centuries and after, attacks from the near West began, in which the Iranian people took over Sindh. A Mir Qasim was the first muslim ruler of Sindh, which prompted the emigration of Hindus from Sindh to Bhuj. Today, there&#39;s two clans which claim ancestry from these immigrants: Nagar-samais, and nagar-samas, each of them originating from a particular area in Sindh.</p>
        <p>A man called Lakho Bura married a woman from Bhuj, and they had four children. Lakho Bura had another wife, from Palitana. This woman from Palitana, she was originally engaged to a rajput prince from a place called Kannauj (pronounciation similar). While on the way to Kannauj, cultural differences arise in the gifts that the woman was giving away to the Sindhi people in Bhuj, and the rajput prince was furious. He cuts the marriage off, and she furiously married Lakho Bura, who was 90 years old at that time. Lakho Bura suggests his son to marry her, but when the woman disagrees, he reluctantly marries her. Being old, Lakho Bura gets sick- but using her magical ayurvedic treatment, the woman brings Lakho back to his youth, and they have four more children!</p>
        <p>The eldest of these eight children was Mor. The eldest child of the second wife was Manal. Because of the ayurvedic treatment and specialities, Lakho weirdly announces his youngest son as the next king. Manal and Mor, jealous, kill their youngest brother. </p>
        <p>They run away to their uncle&#39;s place, called Lakhpath- this was during the 7-8th centuries CE. They&#39;re the ancestors of the people who we know today as the Jadejas.</p>
        <p>After a small period of power loss where the paramaras and the solankis came back to power, a pair of brothers, Lakhiya and Vira, they captured the area back. They&#39;re the ancestors of Khengarji I, who established Kutch as a kingdom and united it. The last king was Maharao Madan Singh, who ruled just for about three months, and fled to England once his kinship expired. Later he served as an Indian emissary to Norway, until he died in 1991. His dynasty continues, his son, Pragmalji III, rules today. </p>

        Rushbrooke Williams- black hills is the most authentic history of the area.</p>
        <p>Lakhpath was so fascinated with Braj Bhasha so much that he got teachers from UP to teach Braj and anyone could come and learn the language for free, and could gain a degree as a poet- go anywhere with that degree in the country, you&#39;d definitely get a job. The school closed in the 1960s, unfortunately. It survived for three hundred years. Kutch gained independence in 1948. In 1960, it joined Gujarat state. That was when the school for Braj was closed, because the then government considered the language not democratic. The building still stands today, near what is today the Ashapuri temple in Bhuj.
        The last teacher of that school was Shambudan gadhvi, who used to work in the Aina Mahal, which still houses manuscripts today.</p>
        <p>A very fascinating part of history of Ram Singh Malam&#39;s story: but according to my research, there was actually no area in the Netherlands which taught chandelier making and architecture.</p>
        <p>There are braj manuscripts in the Aina Mahal library regarding lots of stuff.</p>
        <p>Dutch aur Kacchh- paper</p>
        <p>There&#39;s a significant Portugese influence since th 16th century, and the Dutch in the 18th century, and the British from the 19th century. In the 1819 earthquake, a British doctor called McMurdoe sent a report of the diaster to the East India Company. Earthquakes happen a lot in Bhuj. A big earthquake happens every 50-60 years. Every third generation sees an earthquake. 
        Knowledge is priceless.</p>
        <p>After this talk, and yet another lemonade, we&#39;re back inside the palace complex to talk with another historian, Dalpath Bhai. Here&#39;s his accounts:</p>
        <p>A geographical background: the lifestyle, thinking, and culture of people in an area is based on the geography of the area. So it is important to know that context. My name is Dalpath Danidharia, and I&#39;m a student of a book called Kutch. I learn something new everyday. I worked on a book about the vernacular wisdom of water conservation within the broader context of Kutch. The atmosphere of this area is quite challenging- the tropic of cancer passes through the area, which makes it quite hot and horrid, with up to 250 hot sunny days per year.
        There is a quick rate of evaporation: up to 2 metres per year.
        In my research about vernacular water wisdom, I&#39;ve found out that the water conservation techniques are quite extraordinary, combating the extreme rate of evaporation.
        Etymologically, the name of the area comes from the Sanskrit word kaccha, meaning turtle.
        Every village has about 3-4 lakes surrounding it.
        A port village called Jakkho has over a hundred lakes surrounding it!
        Previously, all of this area was just a forest land. But about 500 years ago, it was a monarchical-jagirdar system. 
        A small habitat in the area is called Wand (in the kacchi language), and most wands are named after the people that live inside it, that trade there.
        Mrgashira maasa, the fifth day of the waning moon. That was day Bhuj was established.
        Our archives have a mission to keep the old structures safe. Self-fulfilled archaeology begins with our home: you want to keep your legacy safe, then keep it.

        <p>With promises of a scrumptious lunch, I follow Sana and Suhana to their room. Suhana performs her prayer while me and Sana lied down on their bed, with the AC turned on- it is quite the necessity in this heat. Just as she finishes her prayer, Niranj knocks on the door, and we begin searching for food to order.
        After Sana and I deciding that we want to eat a simple food, perhaps khichdi, the food gang splits into two, and we end up ordering a thali which me and Sana would share, and a pizza and some garlic bread for suhana. Suhana steps out with Niranj, while Sana and I stay back, basking in the dark and cool room. I pick up my copy of the Black Hills which I bought from the first historian, and start reading it as Sana slowly drifts into sleep beside me. She wakes up and reads what I&#39;ve written, and chuckles. About a while later, lunch arrives, and we head down to eat the food. We eat the food silently- well, Sana and I do, and she retirez to her room after eating. I clean up after her, and realise we forgot to eat a papad: I take it to her room, and sit beside her and give her a few pieces of the papad. Suhana and Niranj are also on the bed, discussing marriage and death and such topics. Me being me, I keep observing them, perhaps joining in with them with a comment or two. 
        Me and Sana come out for a walk along the walls of the darbargarh fort, and we stop at a place where there&#39;s a significant &quot;destruction&quot; in the wall. We look at the wall, and a policeman passing by on his motorcycle looks at us and stops. &quot;No one cares for this anymore,&quot; he tells us. We introduce ourselves as students of history. The policeman continues, &quot;It&#39;s important that people study history. But this, the archaeological department isn&#39;t doing anything. The fort wall keeps falling down,&quot; Sana, perplexed, asks, &quot;keeps falling down? You mean, it fell in the earthquake, right?&quot; A woman peeks her head out the gate of a house. &quot;It keeps falling down,&quot; she says. &quot;I remember a big piece fell down a few months ago. It was like an earthquake. I was sitting in the room just here,&quot; she points towards her living room. &quot;I ran towards my backyard, thinking it was an earthquake, but it turns out, pieces of that wall had fallen down. There were boxes of the king&#39;s treasure, there were jugs and mugs and other things. We weren&#39;t allowed to touch any of the treasure. The people from the Aina Mahal, the ones maintaining the museum, they took them away.&quot; She politely gives us some water cooled in a mud-pot, and we ask her her name: she was Anita Ravi Jethi, and she was the nephew of Pramod Jethi, the historian we had met earlier. Her house doesn&#39;t look quite old. We ask her about it, and she replies, &quot;yes, this house isn&#39;t that old, it was rebuilt after the earthquake. The old house, my grandmother got stuck under it during the earthquake. She died then.&quot; We asked her if she had any old photos of her house. She promptly opened up Facebook and began showing her uncle&#39;s profile, where the historian had documented Bhuj. When Sana asks her about the Saraf Bazaar and the Jubilee Hospital, she shows where they are, and tells us that the Saraf Bazaar had gone viral on Instagram recently. We bid her adieu, telling her that we might return again, and continue on our journey circumambulating the palace.
        We come across what we theorise to be secret pathways to the inside of the palace, where a homeless person might&#39;ve made home- we encountered a strong smell of urine, which later turned out to be the public toilets nearby. In front of the secret pathway, a man tells us that the secret tunnel connects to the Aina Mahal, and was the path of the king&#39;s escape. We take some photos and keep walking. About five minutes of walking later, we come across a giant wall, with pigeons hanging around it. We remark about how literally no single building on the periphery of the wall is old. We see a cow and a bull walking furiously towards us, and we slip inside the veranda of a house, and Sana takes a video of us being scared by the bull.
        We continue walking after the Bulls pass us, and we come across a rather conspicuously placed door, which seems to open to a nonexistent balcony. We walk around the Swaminarayan temple, which seems to be right along one wall of the palace, and we&#39;re on way back towards the hotel. But we aren&#39;t going inside the hotel- we decide to go to the Saraf Bazaar, which is one part of the city that was virtually unaffected by the earthquake. We stop at a shop to buy a water bottle, and ask the shopkeeper how old his shop is. He replies that he was there in Bhuj for 70 years, and his shop collapsed in the earthquake. He says that the density of the old city has changed since the earthquake happened: people have been moving out to th newer part of the city. We buy our water bottles and walk towards Saraf Bazaar.
        After a few minutes of walking, we reach what we recognise through Ashwini&#39;s drawings as the vegetable market. We walk through a cacophony of sounds and smells, through vendors selling chips and other snacks, and into the vegetable market building.
        We walk in it, through floors made of stone, covered in pigeon poop. We ask one of the few vendors in the building about the structure. This is what he told us. 
        &quot;The king made this 150 years ago, with stone and metal. This did not even budge an inch in the earthquake.&quot; 
        Then, another vendor remarks that the he knew when the building was made. We walk towards him, and he says this:
        &quot;1818 the market was made. It originally had wooden platforms, but they broke during the earthquake, and they were replaced with the present stone ones. There used to be small brick walls reaching the height of the present-day platforms, but then those brick walls fell down, and were replaced by the present day stone ones.&quot;
        Using the details that the second vegetable vendor had provided to us, Sana makes a conjectural drawing showing how the wooden tables would&#39;ve been. 
        We come out of the market building and walk around it. 
        We walk through a street filled with vendors selling vegetables, items of worship, fruits, and much more. On our left, we recognise a building to be an old building made by the PWD. It was the old building for the Kutch Distributers Central Co-Operative Bank.
        After a circumambulation of the vegetable market, we continue walking on the original path. Along the road, we find, above that appears to be a shop for dresses, an old house with an ornate grille on the balcony. The shopkeeper tells us that the house is boarded, but that it is around 70-80 years old. He shows us the old boarded steps to the building. A shopkeeper opposite, an old man called  Sabeer, tells us that the house isn&#39;t 80, but 400 years old. It wasn&#39;t much damaged in the earthquake, but is one of the few houses that survived. Sana shows a photo of a house we took earlier, and it is also 400 years old. The shopkeeper tells us to go straight and then right, where he claims there&#39;ll be more old buildings. We walk that path, and come across an old plastered building.
        As we walk, we come across an old shopkeeper of a clothes iron shop, a man called Razak Bhai Mehman who tells us about two newspapers: Kutchmitra, and Divya Bhaskar, who had documented the earthquake, and their offices might&#39;ve had information about the earthquake.
        He suggested we meet Mahmud Hussain Khatri, who once worked at the bank of india, a man who knows his stuff, in an area called Khatri chowk. He might know stuff about the earthquake and what happened then.
        As we finally turn around and walk back to the hotel, we chance upon an incredible sunset with the tower of the Prag Palace visible in front of us. We stop for a moment to take a photo, praise ourselves about how amazing photos we take, and continue walking. 
        We stop at a shop selling bronze figurines of the Bodhisattva among several other things. We talk with the shopkeeper, a man called Umar, and it is a 300-year old shop. The shop sells old wood block tiles, anamorphic cameras, and more. I almost got enamoured in the store and bought an anamorphic camera. Lucky I did not. Sana makes a drawing of the store. The shopkeeper tells us that he has a huge collection of paintings and small trinkets he happened to collect during his travels. He tells that he gets his biggest sales when foreign tourists come here, he&#39;s preparing for that: there&#39;s foreigners supposed to be coming in a month or so.  He tells us how his grandfather was a cricketer in the Bhuj cricket team, during the 1930s or so.
        The shop originally belong to a man called Zalam Singh during the 1700s, whose family gave it to rent for Umar&#39;s family. This shop used to be a safe haven for people who were stuck between both the gates during the night. The road was the same path that the king&#39;s procession used to go from the palace to the Bhujio hill. Saraf Bazaar, during the day, used to populated with foreign merchants and Indian representatives who would sell their wares in the area.
        We walk back to the room where I realise we&#39;re locked out. I grab my power bank from Sana&#39;s room and we walk out again, towards the Mahadev gate. We take the keys to my room from Bhavya, and walk back to the hotel. Back in the hotel, we freshen up and order some food. After a quick power nap, the food is here, and we eat. After eating, we discuss the plans for tomorrow. Me and Sana have our own plans, but we also do have plans to go visit the cenotaphs. Let&#39;s see what ends up happening. I hope I can be with Sana tomorrow- only now am I realising that she&#39;s a good balance for me: for she is seeing the visuals I want to write. Let us see what happens tomorrow. I walk back to my room, where I tuck in for the night.</p>
