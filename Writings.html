    <h2>Writing</h2>
    <p>I occasionally write things that come to my mind. This is where I upload some of them- I haven't organised them in a specific order, or by key-words or tags (because I do not really know how to implement them at the moment, lol) yet. I do intend to do it, perhaps once there are enough articles. I do have a habit of writing the date of when I started writing something, and it can be seen in the titles of the articles on this website.</p>
