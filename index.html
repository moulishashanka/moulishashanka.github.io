<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
<p>John Tuomey is a renowned Irish architect, educator, and writer. Tuomey studied architecture at the University College Dublin (UCD) and emerged as a leading voice in the discipline, emphasizing the importance of context, materiality, and craftsmanship in his work. He founded O’Donnel +Tuomey in 1988 with his spouse, Sheila O’Donnel. Tuomey is also a respected academic, having taught at the UCD and other leading institutions such as Harvard University’s Graduate School of Design and the Architectural Association in London. His teachings focus on the interplay between the architecture and its environment, emphasising the importance of storytelling and historical continuity in design.

  Initial reading:
  In the first paragraph Tuomey writes this:
  
  And there is a case to be made for connecting the widely accepted value of historic architecture to the less well-established position of contemporary architecture in the culture, to pay attention to what Robin Evans once called ‘the small poetic voice of modern architecture’.
  
  Tuomey picks out, as an example to aid this point, his own visit to Chapel de Notre Dame-du-Haut – in the introduction, he picks out excerpts from poets and writers, which at a first glance do not seem necessarily related to architecture, and shows how they help him look at the Chapel.
