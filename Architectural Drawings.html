        <h1>Drawing Architectural Drawings</h1>
        <p><em>17 Feb 2025</em></p>

        <p>A few days ago, I went to Bhopal for some work. On the second day of the trip, I woke up and had a rather unexpected burst of inspiration to draw- I had been looking at open-source architecture the previous night - Wikihouse<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>, the OpenStructures community<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">2</a></sup>, and more.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">3</a></sup> Looking at them gave me an inspiration to draw a building. I had an idea in my mind, I knew what I wanted to draw. Except... It had been almost six, seven years since I drew something. Pen on paper, at least. I had been drawing digitally for about a year, but neither were my drawings about architecture nor was drawing digitally the same as drawing on paper.</p>
        
        <p>I wasn't sure if it would turn out good- I took out a small book and a pencil, and started sketching. In about ten, or fifteen minutes, I had, in front of me, a sketch of a building.</p>

        <p>This is the sketch, in case you were wondering:</p>

        <p>As I looked at the sketch, I realised that it was a reflection of the architecture I had seen living in Gujarat for the past seven months. Gigantic slabs of concrete, with bricks in between- perhaps that is an understatement of the types of architecture the ate has to offer, but again, this was what I had perceived. The sketch was finished. It was done.</p>
