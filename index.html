    The Chola Game Story
</title>

<h1 id="Chola Game Story">Story 8Jan2025</h1>

<p><em>This is still a work in progress. The story is subject to change.</em></p>
<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
<p align="justify">Suparman, a mercenary of half-Indonesian descent, returns to India after multiple years of trade missions near Malacca. In Nagapattinam, he meets his old friend, Aditya, who is investigating a conspiracy that involves the death of the regent- his father. Suparman helps Aditya in his investigation, and they travel to Thanjavur together, where they meet Arulmozhi. Aditya travels to Pazhayarai to continue his investigation, and returns a few weeks later, dissatisfied with his findings. The next day, Suparman heads to the palace to meet Aditya, when there is a royal announcement by a minister stating that Aditya had been assassinated the last night. Before he can react, Suparman is arrested by the royal guards for the murder and is thrown in prison.</p>
<h2 id="act-1">Act 1</h2>
<p><em>A year later</em></p>
<p>Suparman wakes up in prison, his life gotten used to- he barely gets any sleep, the guards occasionally come in to unlock his cell, only to let him be tortured by the ministers. He hallucinates Mayon coming back sometimes. One night, he is knocked out cold by someone who enters into his cell.
He wakes up in what looks like a slave-ship, where he spends the next five days, till he reaches Palembang. There, with the other slaves, he is taken to the office of a merchant guild. Suparman is told that the guild was who freed him, and as repayment, he has to capture a few vague targets and conquer the strait of Malacca. He is given a vessel and a crew, and begins on his quest, wary of the guild. After capturing the first target, he realises that they have a connection with Aditya. Suparman goes to the guild and demands to know who the targets are, and what they want with them. The guild tells him that these six people had a minor connection with the people who conspired to kill Aditya, and it just so happened that the they had an enmity with the conspirators as well.
Over the next four years, Suparman investigates, closes in on the targets and delivers them alive, with each kidnapping revealing more information about the final conspirator, who was supposed to be in India. While all of this is happening, the targets we kidnap turn up dead, with the guild denying any involvement in the killing.
Once enough information is gathered, Suparman sends his spies to India to trace out the final conspirator, while he arrives to India a few weeks later. When he finally arrives, his spies inform him that the final conspirator had been caught, and that he’s in custody. Suparman decides to confront him, and when he finally visits where the conspirator is being held, he is in for a shock when he realises it is Arulmozhi.</p>
<h2 id="act-2">Act 2</h2>
<p>Suparman quickly realises that Arulmozhi isn’t part of the conspiracy, and sets him free. Arulmozhi requests Suparman’s help in an investigation of his own: he reckons that there was someone pulling the strings, someone who did not want their name on any records, behind the assassination of his brother. During this investigation, his informants that he sends to Malacca keep disappearing, courtesy of a man called Mayon. Suparman recognises that name and suspects someone using that name to stop investigation about the assassination of Aditya. He decides to help Arulmozhi. When Suparman’s crew hears of this, they tell him that they had information that Mayon had come to India.
As he and Arulmozhi investigate who Mayon was, Suparman recounts similar patterns which he had seen in the past few years while chasing the targets, and cross-checks the information of the conspirator who was in India with information Arulmozhi had given him, and he realises that Madhurantaka is the conspirator, that he is Mayon. Angrily he heads alone to his palace to capture him. When he finally confronts Madhurantaka, he claims that he had nothing to do with the murder of Aditya. Arulmozhi catches up with Suparman and rushes into the palace, claiming that Madhurantaka is innocent, that he wasn’t Mayon. Mayon was still at large, but there was a bigger conspirator- according to Arulmozhi, at least. Madhurantaka realises who it is: Martanda. He tells them that Martanda had approached him a few years ago, and that he had denied to work with him (obviously Martanda did not tell Madhurantaka his plan to kill Aditya). But this was just a hunch.
Arulmozhi then tells how in his investigation, he had come across five conspirators who had killed Aditya, with Martanda behind the scenes. He had been able to trace four of them out, except Mayon. Suparman agrees to deal with the four conspirators first, while parallelly working on uncovering the identity of Mayon.
Over the next four years, he kills the four targets in sandbox-style missions, each in one area, while also getting close to who Mayon is. Suparman also begins to doubt about the identity of the people he captured in Malacca. The last target reveals to Suparman that it was indeed all Martanda’s doing, but he’d never be able to kill him, because he had Mayon with him. When asked who Mayon was, the target tells him that his identity was a secret, but he was framed of being the murderer of Aditya, and he was rescued.
That is when Suparman realises that he was Mayon all along, and that the guild he had been working for was Martanda’s men.</p>
<h2 id="act-3">Act 3</h2>
<p>Suparman reveals to Arulmozhi and Madhurantaka his findings, and they finally decide that it was time for Martanda’s tale to come to an end. Individually, over the next few years, they attack all of Martanda’s guild and bases. Once he is left all alone, the three attack Martanda, and in the fight, just as Martanda’s life gives away, Madhurantaka dies too, leaving Arulmozhi to be the king.</p>
<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<p>Arulmozhi is crowned king. Suparman decides to leave his life of a mercenary and sets his journey back home. He stops at one of the Andaman Islands, and kills himself.</p>
