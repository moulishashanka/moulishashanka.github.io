        <h1>Writing a Poem</h1>
        <em>21 Feb 2025</em>
        
        <p>I've an early class on fridays- at 8 30 am. I understand that 8 30 am isn't too early, but compared to my other classes, which start at 11 am, this is quite early.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> I was in one such class earlier today - it was running in a slow pace, and I opened snapchat on my phone. I had gotten a snap from a friend of mine, Mukul, who had put a picture of the ceiling of the hotel he was staying at, and the word, "peace".</p>

        <p>Mukul had visited the shrine at Tirupati a few days ago, and had shaved his head for that. And as I saw his snap, I felt an urge to write a poem, and I did.</p>

        <p>I call it a poem, but it was a convoluted sentence.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> Here's what I wrote:</p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-family: Anek Telugu;"><em>రోమాటవినిఁదలపైబెట్టుకున్నవానికి</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-family: Anek Telugu;"><em>గిరినాథునికొరకు కురులనియ్యగా</em></p><p style="text-align: center; font-family: Anek Telugu;"><em>తలపైభారంబుదగ్గి  </em></p><p style="text-align: center; font-family: Anek Telugu;"><em>నిమ్మళంబనిపించె, చెలికాడా!</em></p>

        <p>Here's a transliteration of the "poem":</p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>rōmāṭavinim̐dalapaibeṭṭukunnavāniki</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>girināthunikoraku kurulaniyyagā</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>talapaibhārambudaggi  </em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>nimmaḷambanipiñce, celikāḍā!</em></p>

        <p>And here's a translation of the same:</p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>The fellow with dense, forest-like hair on his head,
            when he gave away his hair for the lord atop the hills,
            feeling relieved with his bald head,
            felt at peace, my friend!</em></p>

        <p>Sounds rather a-poetic, doesn't it?</p>
        <p>It was my first time writing a poem in Telugu, and close enough to be an actual one with rules of metre and prosody.</p>

        <p>That is exactly what Mukul said. He challenged me to write a poem in the āṭaveladi metre. I had never written one before, so I was intruiged. After looking up how an āṭaveladi poem was supposed to be written on Wikipedia, I began writing the poem.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></p>

        <p>Before I show you the poem, here's the rules of an āṭaveladi poem:</p>
        <li>Theres four lines, each line called a <em>pāda</em>.</li>
        <li>The first and third pāda-s contain syllables in a specific order, and the second and fourth pāda-s contain syllables in a specific order.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></li>
        <li>The <em>yati</em> syllable is the first syllable of the fourth gaṇa.</li>
        <li>If yati isn't possible, prāsayati is permitted.</li>

        <p>I understood the first and second rules- not the other two. Unfazed, I looked up the syllable order format of an āṭaveladi poem, and wrote one. This is how it went:</p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-family: Anek Telugu;"><em>తిరుగిరులనటవినమీద వేల్పేచ్ఛపై </em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-family: Anek Telugu;"><em>తనకురులనుక్షవరమిచ్చి అర్పించి</em></p><p style="text-align: center; font-family: Anek Telugu;"><em>శిరస్సునఁబరువు తగ్గగా, శాంతిగావుందే,  </em></p><p style="text-align: center; font-family: Anek Telugu;"><em>నిమ్మలమనిపించునని జెప్పెను చెలియ!</em></p>

        <p>Here's a transliteration of this poem:</p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>tirugirulanaṭavinamīda vēlpēcchapai</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>tanakurulanukṣavaramicci arpiñci</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>śirassunam̐baruvu taggagā, śāntigāvundē,</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>nimmalamanipiñcunani jeppenu celiya!</em></p>

        <p>And here's a translation:</p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>Atop the Tirumala hills, in the forests, by the wish of the god of Lakshmi,
            He shaved his hair as an offering,
            And as the mass above his head reduced, he felt at peace,
            And told me that it was nice, my friend!</em></p>

        <p>This certainly wasn't perfect: the syllables matched with the gana-s in the āṭaveladi metre, but of course, it was not following the rules of yati.</p>
        
        <p>Now, here came one of the most difficult parts of writing this poem. I spent about an hour looking at what yati was- it proved barely useful: here's an image of my chat with Mukul to understand how I was feeling.</p>

        <img src="./Images/Pasted image 20250221175302.png">

        <p>Things did not feel right.</p>

        <p>I felt absolutely broken- I had no idea what yati was, or how it worked at all. Fortunately for me, there was YouTube. I spent more time looking at videos of how things worked in the āṭaveladi metre.</p>

        <p>Watching videos was one thing, but writing an actual poem following those rules?</p>

        <p>This part, was, by far, the hardest and longest part of writing this poem- there were times when I was stuck, looking at my laptop screen, wondering what to write. Before I could fix the yati, I began to correct my gana-s, which I had realised had some errors, and rewrote the poem:</p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-family: Anek Telugu;"><em>తిరుగిరులనటవినమీద వేల్పేచ్ఛపై</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-family: Anek Telugu;"><em>తనకురులుకయించి భారము కుఱు</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-family: Anek Telugu;"><em>చపడి నిమ్ము తోఁచుచూ శాంతి గావుంద </em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-family: Anek Telugu;"><em>నికదియించెఁనతడు నాకు చెలియ!</em></p>

        <p>Here's a transliteration:</p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>tirugirulanaṭavinamīda vēlpēcchapai  </em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>tanakurulukayiñci bhāramu kuṟu</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>capaḍi nimmu tōm̐cucū śānti gāvunda</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>nikadiyiñcem̐nataḍu nāku celiya!</em></p>

        <p>The meaning of the poem hasn't changed, so I aren't going to give a translation for this version.</p>

        <p>After fixing the gana-s, I began trying out multiple lines to test the yati. This is how I was working things out, line by line, fixing the gana-s and the yati together.</p>

        <img src="./Images/Pasted image 20250221183314.png">

        <p>Then, after about five hours of me sitting and working on this had passed, I finally got it- I showed the poem to Mukul excitedly. This is that version:</p>

        
        <p style="text-align: center; font-family: Anek Telugu;"><em>తిరుగిరులనటవిన తిరువేల్పేచ్ఛపై</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-family: Anek Telugu;"><em>శిరకురులుకయించి భారముకుఱు</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-family: Anek Telugu;"><em>చపడి హాయితోఁచి శాంతిగా నుందని </em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-family: Anek Telugu;"><em>యతడు నాకు, చెలియ, అవధరించె!</em></p>

        <p>Here's a transliteration:</p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>tirugirulanaṭavina tiruvēlpēcchapai</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>śirakurulukayiñci bhāramukuṟu</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>capaḍi hāyitōm̐ci śāntigā nundani</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>yataḍu nāku, celiya, avadhariñce!</em></p>

        <p>And again, I had conserved the meaning of the poem. So no translation here too.</p>

        <p>I sent it to my dad, who was a poet, and had knowledge of metre in Telugu poetry. Apart from a grammatical correction, one thing he made me realise was that I was wrong with the gana-syllables. The first line was incorrect. After looking through it, Mukul and I bounced ideas off, about it. And with Mukul contributing a corrected first line, here is the final poem, with perfect metre and prosody:</p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-family: Anek Telugu;"><em>సప్తగిరులనందు సర్వేశ్వరునిఁగోరి</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-family: Anek Telugu;"><em>శిరకురులుకయించ భారముకుఱు</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-family: Anek Telugu;"><em>చపడి హాయితోఁచి శాంతిగా నుందని </em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-family: Anek Telugu;"><em>యతడు నాకు, చెలియ, అవధరించె!</em></p>

        <p>Here's a transliteration:</p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>_saptagirulanandu sarvēśvarunim̐gōri</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>śirakurulukayiñca bhāramukuṟu</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>capaḍi hāyitōm̐ci śāntigā nundani</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>yataḍu nāku, celiya, avadhariñce!</em></p>

        <p>And finally, a final translation:</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>After wishing upon the lord atop the seven hills,
        and letting go of the hair (atop his) head,
        feeling relieved, he said it
        felt at peace, my friend!</em></p>

        <p>This, was my first poem. Here's to more of them.🤌<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></p>
